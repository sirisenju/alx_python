# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Welcome to the "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python" repository! This readme provides a quick overview of key OOP concepts in Python.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Classes and Objects

- **Class:** Blueprint for creating objects. Defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.

- **Object:** An instance of a class. It has its own unique data but follows the structure defined by the class.

### 2. Encapsulation

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). Access to data is controlled to prevent unintended changes.

### 3. Inheritance

- **Inheritance:** Creating a new class (subclass or derived class) from an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass.

### 4. Polymorphism

- **Polymorphism:** Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. Different classes can have methods with the same name but different implementations.

### 5. Method Overriding

- **Method Overriding:** In a subclass, you can provide a new implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.

### 6. Abstract Classes and Interfaces

- **Abstract Class:** A class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It can define abstract methods, which must be implemented by its subclasses.

- **Interface:** A class with abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. In Python, abstract classes are used to define interfaces.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sirisenju/alx_python.git`
2. Explore the code examples in each concept's directory.
3. Experiment with the code to see how OOP works in Python.
